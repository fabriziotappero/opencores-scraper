On each rising-edge of the clock (when en is high), the coefficients and input x term are sampled at the function inputs. The result has a latency of 3 clock cycles.  All inputs to the function are 8-bit signed fractions, with the generic parameter 'fw' specifying the number of fraction bits.  The output result is a 24-bit signed fraction.  If integer arithmetic is preferred, then the parameter fw should be set to 0.  For larger bit-widths, t</div>

Since the Red/Green/Blue (RGB) LEDs on the strip are driven by a serial controller IC that is also on the strip, your project can set each LED color independently of the others.The connections to the LED strip include 4 wires: +5V, GND, clock and data.

Port list for unconfuser.2. Address for each pad.3. Polynomials used for each pad.4. Steps to be followed to code state machine.5. Diagrams briefly explaining confuser and unconfuser working.Hope this much information would be sufficient to grasp everything about project.The project need to be optimized for number of gates, Have 12k count for now need to make it to around 8k. Hope it will be done in 2 weeks :)</div>

The different stages of the decoding process are implemented in a pipelined design described in VHDL. Running on a Virtex-II Pro FPGA at 100 MHz operation frequency. The pipelined structure allows for the processing of multiple image blocks simultanously. Thus, the decoder is prepared to decode MotionJPEG movies. Functionality of the system is demonstrated with a proof-of-concept hardware MotionJPEG video player application.Features- jpeg baseline decoding- mjpeg- display decoded data on</div>
